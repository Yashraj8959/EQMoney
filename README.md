**Project Title: EQ Money - Seamless Shared Expense Handling**
Abstract:
In today's interconnected world, shared expenses are a common occurrence, whether it's a group trip with friends, shared rent among roommates, or collaborative projects. Managing these expenses efficiently and fairly can be a challenging task. "EQ money" is a comprehensive money management system designed to streamline the process of tracking, splitting, and settling shared expenses.

Introduction:
The project "EQ Money" is born out of the recognition that in our fast-paced, globally connected lives, the need for a modern and adaptable solution for shared expense management has never been greater.

•	React: The front-end of EQ Money is built with React, a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React allows for a seamless and responsive user experience.
•	Node.js: Serving as the server environment, Node.js powers the server-side logic, allowing for high-speed data processing and real-time updates.
